Hello, I’m Onur <br />

I work in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields. I have completed/participated in some classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects. <br />
I’m currently doing research on Explainability in AI (XAI) and specific methods in Natural Language Processing. <br />
I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the scope of my research field of interest. <br />
You can simply reach me out via my e-mail address.
